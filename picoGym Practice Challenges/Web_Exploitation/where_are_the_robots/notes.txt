Well the key to this one is in the title.
I already know that there is something called robots.txt in websites.

IT tells search engine crawlers which pages or files the crawler can or can't read.
However I didnt thought that it maybe hiding something that the creator dont want us to find.

Well in the robots.txt file I find the page where I got the flag. Better to keep this in mind from next time. . .
