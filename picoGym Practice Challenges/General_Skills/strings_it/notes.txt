Well this one is self-explained!
The name of the challenge have strings in it, also hint says to check out the man page for strings.

So to solve this, I first used strings and funneled the output to a text file.
Then I used grep to find the flag staring with picoCTF, as I know thats how it starts.

$strings strings > output.txt
$grep "picoCTF" file

So thats how I found the flag. . .
