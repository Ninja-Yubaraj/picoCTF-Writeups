This one is easy when you read the hints.

The first Hint asks to learn and practise how to connect to an ip and port with nc.
The second refers to a ascii ctf pointing out that we are gonna get some ascii in here.

So, Therefore I completed both.
After that, this looks very easy.

Got the netcat connect running by using "nc ip port"
and then used a online tool to convert the ascii data to text.

Thats How I got the flag.
