The module is Mod 26

As stated, we need to decrypt a simple string in Rot 13.

So, wiki says "ROT13 is a simple letter substitution cipher that replaces a letter with the 13th letter after it in the alphabet.
ROT13 is a special case of the Caesar cipher which was developed in ancient Rome."

Simply put, take a letter, lets say "H", move to next 13 spaces, now its "U"
Thus, "HELLO" is "URYYB"

Hint says you can do this by hand, or maybe use any tool to do it.

Its stated right. Cryptography is easy when you know what are you doing.
Simply put, take a character or a string, change it with another with a pre-defined technique or path and then dont forget it or say good bye to the data in the string. . .
