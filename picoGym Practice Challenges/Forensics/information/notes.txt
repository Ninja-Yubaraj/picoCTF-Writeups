I saw this one coming.

So it seems out, we can have files inside of files, or "HIDDEN" information inside of other files.
Thats why they thought its a nice name for this module.

Well I first downloaded the image, saw it, it was cute.

First Hint said to get some details about the image.
Tried to "cat" the cat, it failed, simply put binary stuff.
Again tried to use "strings" on the cat, failed again, random garbage output.
Then I thought to use a tool to check the metadeta of the image.
This tools is "exiftool".

All things seems normal, except the license part.
Hint says the flag will be always something like picoCTF{XXXXX}
I am not that experienced, but it looks Base64.

Decoded it with "echo cGljb0NURnt0aGVfbTN0YWRhdGFfMXNfbW9kaWZpZWR9 | base64 -d"
It worked. God my flag. And I am ready to go.

The best mindset for CTF is to always look for a anomaly in standard patterns.
Find the missing blocks, search for them, try something else, even check the holes.

However, in real life, I may spend my entire life to find it and close my eyes trying.
But in CTF, theres always a missing block, just look for it. . .
